Sandbox
=======

This repo has been created for the sole purpose of placing Tutorials and the associated code from my website blog. At least for now I am going to keep things separated by creating a new branch for each tutorial, blog post, etc. 

I don't plan to have anything in the master branch at this time outside of this readme file. 

As time goes on I will update this file to have a list of the branches with links to the tutorials, blog posts, etc for ease of reference.


PHP/AJAX: Call a specific PHP function
============================
https://github.com/rantoine/Sandbox/tree/PhpAjaxCall

Recently, I was asked by a friend how to call a specific php function via an Ajax call. The challenge was that they originally set out to have specific functions handle different form posts throughout the website, but wanted to have them all orgianized in a single php file.

As such I decided that I would put a quick tutorial together showing a PHP/Ajax call to a specific function. However, as a began down the path of putting this tutorial together I decided that I would leverage Twitter Bootstrap. Then I decided that I would show a couple of different options. Shortly after which I decided to show the posting of a form via Ajax from a Modal. Needless to say this has grown to be a bit larger than I had orignally intended.
